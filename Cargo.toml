# The `wasm-bindgen` crate provides the bare minimum functionality needed
# to interact with JavaScript.
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.71"

# `wee_alloc` is a tiny allocator for wasm that is only ~1K in code size
# compared to the default allocator's ~10K. However, it is slower than the default
# allocator, so it's not enabled by default.
wee_alloc = { version = "0.4.5", optional = true }

# The `console_error_panic_hook` crate provides better debugging of panics by
# logging them with `console.error`. This is great for development, but requires
# all the `std::fmt` and `std::panicking` infrastructure, so it's only enabled
# in debug mode.
